Welcome to the **Pico-Ducky** project! 

This repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to turn your **Raspberry Pi Pico W** into a DIY Rubber Ducky. Forget the expensive hardware and have fun with this budget-friendly, highly customizable alternative!

## ðŸ“¦ Fun with Payload
- Step 1: Download an image file..
- Step 2: Create 200 copies of that image on the desktop.
- Step 3: Open YouTube, crank up the volume, and spam infinite tabs with the same video
- The only way to stop it is a system restart

- A Demo can be found **[here](https://youtu.be/1jiClD-XB6o#)**
